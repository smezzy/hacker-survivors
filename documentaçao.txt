###HOW TO USE THIS SHIT

main.current.main:
-> main is the ~Main~ state, a state which holds all the states and manage transitions to other states
-> current is the current ~State~
-> last main, is the main ~Group~ of the current state, a group where all objects/entities within the state resides

How to create a state:
   You can create a state by copying the "StateTemplate" file, a state is instantiated by using main:add(<State>('StateName')), then the state
   will be added to the state list, and can be started by using main:goto_state('StateName')

How to create a GameObject:
   Copy the "GameObject" template file, all game objects must have a group, and it must instantiate itself by calling self.group:add(self)
   all objects must also have a remove property, so it can be safely removed from the game if needed
   it's a good practice to return self after creation so you can do stuff like ~ local bullet = bullet(group, x, y) ~

Important features:
   Timer:
      - timer:tween(seconds, object, { properties to tween })
      - timer:after(seconds, function() end)
